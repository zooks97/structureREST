PLATON is a versatile SHELXL2014 compatible crystallographic tool implementing:

- a large variety of standard geometrical calculations (i.e. bonds, angles,
  torsions, planes, rings, inter-molecular contacts (H-Bond analysis),
  Coordination etc.), either fully automatic or as specified by the user, 

- tests: (i.e. ADDSYM (building on Yvon LePage's powerful published 
  MISSYM (C) algorithm), VOIDS etc.) for the detection of missed symmetry,

- utilities: (cell transformation, reflection file transformation
  (including direction cosines), SHELXL input etc.), PDB & CIF output

- graphics: (e.g. automatic labelled 'ORTEP-lookalike plots, the molecular
  graphics program PLUTON and NEWMAN plots, inspection for completeness
  of the dataset with ASYM-VIEW) 

- several filters: (i.e. Exact (analytical/ de Meulenaer & Tompa) face-indexed
  correction for absorption, DELABS (the locally modified Walker & Stuart
  DIFABS technique for empirical absorption correction, psi-scan based
  correction, MULABS using multiple scanned reflections following the
  Blessing algoritm) and SQUEEZE for handling disordered solvents
  (= BYPASS procedure, (v.d. Sluis & Spek, Acta Cryst. (1990), A46, 194))).

- Validation checks for data supplied in CIF-Format, implementing most
  published tests done in Chester on papers submitted for publication
  in Acta Cryst + a large number of 'PLATON-related' tests. 

- Automatic interface to the Cambridge Structural Database

- The program HELENA for datareduction of CAD4 data into SHELX format
  (plus direction cosines)

- SYSTEM-S for automated structure determination using numerous internal
  and external tools (SHELX, SIR, DIRDIF, CRUNCH).

Most PLATON features complement those available in the widely distributed
public domain SHELXL2014 package (e.g. spacegroup determination and
graphics).

Note: Most features are currently available only for non-protein structures.


              WHAT COORDINATE DATA INPUT STANDARDS ARE ACCEPTED
              ================================================= 

Parameter data may be given in various formats including CSD-FDAT, CIF, PDB &
SHELX-RES standards. Note: there are some restrictions on atom labelling (A4).

A CIF file is recommended when su's (= e.s.d.'s) on the derived geometry
parameters are desired. (see examples) 

                    REFLECTION DATA FORMAT
                    ======================

Reflection data should be provided in the SHELX format (optionally with
SHELX76-style direction cosines.
Some program options also accept SHELXL97-style FO/FC CIF's as reflection
input.


                     WHAT DOES IT COST?
                     ==================
The Program may be used free of charge by the academic community under
the condition that it is not redistributed (just give the pointer to
this anonymous ftp server (xraysoft.chem.ruu.nl) for a current & fresh copy. 
The author is interested in reports of misbehaviour and suggestions for 
additional features.

There is a charge of US$ 5000 for commercial users (as a contribution
to our continuing research efforts).

                 HOW TO OBTAIN A COPY OF PLATON
                 ==============================
In order to get a copy of the program source you will have to copy
(and uncompress) the two files platon.f.gz and xdrvr.c and compile
and link them into an executable with the name 'platon' (see example file
with the name compile) and when desirable, a soft link pluton to
platon.

(A compiled version - not always up-to-date - may be extracted by
copying and uncompress platon.gz from the appropriate platform
directory)

Alternatively, copy 'platon.tar.Z' which contains all files 
in the generic 'unix' directory (will compile without any change on DEC,
SUN, SGI and LINUX platforms).

For the Validation feature, a copy of the file 'check.def' will be 
needed.

                          HOW TO COMPILE
                          ==============
On most UNIX implementations a compile line like the one given below
should be sufficient:

	gfortran -o platon platon.f xdrvr.c -lX11


                     MENUS AND MOUSE CLICKING
                     ========================

PLATON (UNIX-version) attempts by default to open an X-Window Menu.
When it doesn't succeed, it automatically switches to interactive input
from the keyboard and TEK4010 graphics (Keyboard input as default is
choosen when PLATON is called with the '-o' option.)

In the menu mode, input can be given either from the keyboard (useful
for the more complex instructions) or via mouse clicks.

The X-window area is devided in four sub-windows. 

1 - The main graphics area in the upper-left corner (also used for the main
    PLATON (opening)menu from which various (sub)programs can be started
    by mouse clicks). 
2 - The upper-right window carries varies sup-menus with clickable options. 
    Currently active options are displayed in RED. 
    Entries in this menu with vertical lines indicate click-position 
    sensitive options or magnitudes. 
    The yellow top-field may be clicked to reflesh the window contents.
3 - The Lower-Left window is used for short messages and the display of
    keyboard input.
4 - The lower-right window informs about the current input status.
    It also provides an easy 'Exit' by clicking on it.

More extensive output is produced on the window from which the program 
was started and on the listing file.

                   INTRODUCTORY TUTORIAL
                   =====================

A Sample run of the program (with the test data on 'sucrose.spf', to
be copied as well) is done with the command line (excluding quotes): 

 'platon sucrose'

followed by the interactive instructions (on the program prompt >>):

>> CALC

(or click on 'CALC ALL')

This will give an exhaustive geometry analysis. The main results are
on the listing file to be printed on an (ascii) lineprinter (Some summary
information is also directed to the display).

alternatively, the instruction (after restarting the program):

>> CALC ADDSYM 

will provide a test for missed symmetry (cf. the LePage MISSYM (C) algorithm),
or:

>> CALC SOLV 

will do a calculation to identify missed solvent areas or

>> TABL ACC

will generate a file as a starting point of a CIF-file suitable for
submission to Acta Cryst C.

A default labelled ORTEP is produced with:

>> PLOT ADP

The SQUEEZE filter needs two inputfiles: 1) a shelxl.hkl (HKLF 4)
reflection file and 2) a shelxl.res file containing the current
refined parameter set (excluding atoms modeling the disordered 
solvent area). The calculations are done with the instructions

>> CALC SQUEEZE

A file named shelxl.hkp contains a new reflection file where the
disordered solvent contribution is substracted from the observed data.
Further refinement can be done against this new file.

** Note: The SQUEEZE filter has been used succesfully for structures
         containing disordered toluene or similar molecules. Experience
         is still building up and there is no quarantee that the program
         will do the right thing on unfamiliar terrain (in particular
         additional disorder in the discrete structural part has to be
         sorted out for their effect on the solvent area).   

         See also 'How_to_use_SQUEEZE


                 ANALYTICAL ABSORPTION CORRECTION
                 ================================
For those having crystals that can be face-indexed there is the 
easy-to-use implementation of the de Meulenaar & Tompa absorption
correction method.
This filter may be invoked with:

                 platon shelxl.ins

again, you will need a 'shelxl.hkl' file including the direction cosines
The file shelxl.ins should contain:

TITL text
CELL lambda a b c alpha beta gamma
FACE h k l d 
......
ABST mu

The d-values are the distances of an arbitrary point within the crystal
to their corresponding faces. d & mu should be given either both in
mm or both in cm.

See also the Test-example directory.


                       RECIPROCAL LATTICE SYMMETRY
                        =========================

The symmetry of the reciprocal lattice at hand may be inspected with 
the PLATON/ASYM utility for a given shelx.hkl file. See test directory.

                              PLUTON
                              ======

The previously available stand-alone molecular graphics program PLUTON is
now available as an option within PLATON. The original PLUTON is now
obsolete and no longer supported & maintained. 

There are three ways to run the PLUTON option within PLATON

1 - with the '-p' option on the command line

    e.g. 'platon -p sucrose.spf'

2 - with a 'softlink' of 'pluton' to the 'platon' executable:

    i.e.  'ln -s platon pluton'

    sothat PLUTON can be invoked as usual: 'pluton sucrose.spf'

3 - the PLATON instruction 'PLUTON' (or clicking on 'toPluton') 

Note: Clicking in the main PLATON-MENU on the button PLUTON will result
      in a PLATON-run to generate an input file for PLUTON to make both
      consistent.

                          GRAPHICS
                          ========

Various graphics standards are supported including X-Window, HP-GL,
Tek4010, PostScript (Also suitable for MacUsers).

                        X-WINDOW MENU
                        =============
PLATON:
======

By default, a menu is shown from which the desired options can be
MOUSE-CLICKED. Traditional Keyboard entry is possible either through
the 'MenuOff' button or by starting the program with the '-o' option
on the command line.

PLUTON:   (via platon -p or pluton --> platon soft link)
======

By default, a PLOT instruction will bring up a MENU (X-window mode only)
from which mouse-driven options may be run. The more complex
instructions may be given via the keyboard. The menu-feature is switched
off either through a menu option or with the instruction MENU OFF
(to be given before the first PLOT instruction).

                       HARD-COPY GRAPHICS
                       ==================

Hard copies of the current display are conveniently obtained as a
(meta) file by clicking on the 'Meta' option. By default, a PostScript
file (Landscape Mode), suitable to be sent to a PostScript laser printer
will be produced. Alternatively, the instruction 'SET META HPGL' will
make the default HPGL (suitable when graphics is to be included in
a wordprocessor environment (e.g. WordPerfect)).

                   RAY-TRACED MOLECULAR GRAPHICS
                   ============================= 

High quality (color)graphics is easily obtained with the excellent
Public Domain package POV-Ray. The required input files for that
program are conveniently generated using the 'POV' button in the
PLUTON menu. This will generate a '.pov' file with the current 
content, style and orientation of the current PLUTON-display.

POV-Ray (information) may be obtained from:

http://www.povray.org  and ftp.povray.org.
 
                          PRINTING
                          ========

PLATON generates an extensive listing file '?.lis' that can be viewed with an
editor and an equivalent PostScript file (?.lps) that can be inspected
with a PostScript viewer (Ghostscript) or sent to a PostScript
LaserPrinter.

                          CIF-VALIDATION
                          ==============

PLATON can be run in a special mode to provide some validation checking
of CIF's. It is still experimental with  criteria not necessarily
final. Most warnings can be signs of unresolved problems that should
be looked at more closely and at least discussed in the experimental
section of the paper when sent for publication.

One of the options to run the feature on 'sk5555.cif' is via:

        platon -u sk5555.cif

The check-output can be found in: sk5555.chk

Note: make sure that the file 'check.def' is present in the current
      directory
      Alternatively, set the environment variable CHECKDEF to where this
      file is located.

Alternatively, the feature can be run from the platon opening window.

Note: This validation procedure is intended as a 'structural' addition
      to the checking already done by the Chester Acta Cryst office 
      for 'C-papers'. It does not support all the published checks
      done in Chester.

                          HTML-MANUAL
                          ===========

By default, manual info is available over the network using NETSCAPE.

Alternatively, the manual tree can be loaded locally. 
An environment variable PLAHTM should be set to point to the local
location.
The manual set may change with later distributions and should be
refreshed accordingly.

                          MISCELLANIOUS
                          =============
Further information on available instructions is obtained with
the instruction:

HELP
                        **********************

Caveat: This is a RESEARCH-program that is upgraded regularly on an
        event-driven basis on the needs (experience, bug reports, new insight)
        of our national single crystal service facility (over 200 mainly
        organometallic structures/year), local crystallographic
        research, CIF's received as coeditor of Acta Cryst C  and external
	user reports. It represents the current status (with possible loose
        ends to be filled in later or options needing fine-tuning in the
        field).

        Extensive local modification of the source code is discouraged.
        There are usualy major changes in the source code between released
        versions. (For this reason, most comment is left out from the
        distributed source code). 
        
        Please inform me about problems and check regularly for more
        up-to-date versions (where problems encountered may have been
        solved in the meantime). Please sent the insulting files to
        'a.l.spek@chem.uu.nl'.


Thanks: to all users who contribute(d) in many ways to the development
        of the features now present in PLATON and authors of 
        crystallographic software who will find some of their 
        excellent ideas intertwined into PLATON.
