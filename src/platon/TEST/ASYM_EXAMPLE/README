PLATON/ASYM - UTILITY   - 15-6-95
=================================

Given a standard shelx.hkl file, an extensive listing of the averaging
and completeness of your dataset is produced on the basis of the
proposed Space Group symmetry.

Given two files: asym.hhl (= shelx.hkl) and asym.ins
the program may be run with the instruction:

platon asym.ins

The same should work with a file asym.fcf, formatted following
SHELXL97.
