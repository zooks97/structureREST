The compilation compound for PLATON should look like:

(sudo) gfortran -o platon platon.f xdrvr.c -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11

sudo appears to be needed for compilation on Mac OS X/Yosemite but not
with linux distributions.

Mac OS X Yosemite:

Install the latest XQuartz, gfortran, gcc, Xcode and command line tools
