    "Bond-orientational order in molecular dynamics simulations of supercooled liquids and in models of metallic glasses is studied. Quadratic and third-order invariants formed from bond spherical harmonics allow quantitative measures of cluster symmetries in these systems. A state with short-range translational order, but extended correlations in the orientations of particle clusters, starts to develop about 10% below the equilibrium melting temperature in a supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid. The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model. In contrast, we find essentially perfect icosahedral bond correlations in alternative \"amorphon\" cluster models of glass structure."

    "Owing to the different ways in which crystal structures may be described, isotypic compounds are often not identified as such. To remedy this situation, crystal structure data can be standardized by means of the STRUCTURE TIDY program. In the standardized data of isotypic structures, occupied sites have the same Wyckoff representation. This makes it possible to use the Wyckoff sequence (the letters of occupied Wyckoff sites) to classify crystal structure types. This classification is much finer than the previously used classification based on the Pearson code and is of great help if one wants to know whether a particular atom arrangement is already known. The standardization has enabled us not only to demonstrate new cases of isotypism, but also to discover structural relationships between different structure types with the same space group, for example substitution, vacancy or filled-in variants.\n",

    "***A Method for Hierarchical Comparative Analysis of Crystal Structures***\n",
    "A geometrical-topological description of crystal structure as a three-dimen- sional graph with coloured nodes, weighted and coloured edges is used to generate a hierarchical sequence of the structure representations. The solid angles of Voronoi–Dirichlet polyhedra of atoms are used as the edge weights and the nodes and edges are coloured according to chemical reasons. Two operations are defined to derive the representations: contracting an atom to other atoms keeping the local connectivity, and removing an atom together with all its bonds. The atoms of the crystal structure are called origin, removed, contracted or target according to their roles in the operations. Each structure representation is described as a labelled quotient graph and determined by (i) colours of the graph nodes and edges, (ii) some level for edge weights, and (iii) an arrangement of atoms according to their roles. The computer enumeration and topological comparative analysis of all representations for crystal structures of any composition and complexity are implemented into the TOPOS program package. The advantages of the method are shown by the analysis of typical inorganic compounds and a molecular packing.\n",

    "It is widely accepted that correctly accounting for polarization within simulations involving water is critical if the structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of such systems are to be accurately reproduced. We propose a novel potential for the water dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer that includes polarization explicitly, for use in molecular dynamics simulations. Using thousands of dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer clusters sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation lacking polarization, we train (artificial) neural networks (NNs) to predict the atomic multipole moments of a central water molecule. The input of the neural nets consists solely of the coordinates of the water molecules surrounding the central water. The multipole moments are calculated by the atomic partitioning defined by quantum chemical topology (QCT). This method gives a dynamic multipolar representation of the water electron density without explicit polarizabilities. Instead, the required knowledge is stored in the neural net. Furthermore, there is no need to perform iterative calculations to self- consistency during the simulation nor is there a need include damping terms in order to avoid a polarization catastrophe."

    "Neural networks offer an unbiased and numerically very accurate approach to represent highdimensional ab initio potential-energy surfaces. Once constructed, neural network potentials can provide the energies and forces many orders of magnitude faster than electronic structure calculations, and thus enable molecular dynamics simulations of large systems. However, Cartesian coordinates are not a good choice to represent the atomic positions, and a transformation to symmetry functions is required. Using simple benchmark systems, the properties of several types of symmetry functions suitable for the construction of high-dimensional neural network potential-energy surfaces are discussed in detail. The symmetry functions are general and can be applied to all types of systems such as molecules, crystalline and amorphous solids, and liquids."

    "We introduce a machine learning model to predict atomization energies of a diverse set of organic molecules, based on nuclear charges and atomic positions only. The problem of solving the molecular Schrödinger equation is mapped onto a nonlinear statistical regression problem of reduced complexity. Regression models are trained on and compared to atomization energies computed with hybrid density- functional theory. Cross validation over more than seven thousand organic molecules yields a mean absolute error of ~10 kcal/mol. Applicability is demonstrated for the prediction of molecular atomization potential energy curves."

    "We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighborhood environments, and analyze their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.\n",

    "There is a clear need for a practical and mathematically rigorous description of local structure in inorganic compounds so that structures and chemistries can be easily compared across large data sets. Here a method for decomposing crystal structures into substructures is given, and a similarity function between those substructures is defined. The similarity function is based on both geometric and chemical similarity. This construction allows for large-scale data mining of substructural properties, and the analysis of substructures and void spaces within crystal structures. The method is validated via the prediction of Li-ion intercalation sites for the oxides. Tested on databases of known Li-ion-containing oxides, the method reproduces all Li-ion sites in an oxide with a maximum of 4 incorrect guesses 80% of the time."

    "Evaluating the (dis)similarity of crystalline, disordered and molecular compounds is a critical step in the development of algorithms to navigate automatically the configuration space of complex materials. For instance, a structural similarity metric is crucial for classifying structures, searching chemical space for better compounds and materials, and driving the next generation of machine-learning techniques for predicting the stability and properties of molecules and materials. In the last few years several strategies have been designed to compare atomic coordination environments. In particular, the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAPs) has emerged as an elegant framework to obtain translation, rotation and permutation-invariant descriptors of groups of atoms, underlying the development of various classes of machine-learned inter-atomic potentials. Here we discuss how one can combine such local descriptors using a regularized entropy match (REMatch) approach to describe the similarity of both whole molecular and bulk periodic structures, introducing powerful metrics that enable the navigation of alchemical and structural complexities within a unified framework. Furthermore, using this kernel and a ridge regression method we can predict atomization energies for a database of small organic molecules with a mean absolute error below 1 kcal mol$^-1$, reaching an important milestone in the application of machine-learning techniques for the evaluation of molecular properties.\n"

    "Measuring similarities/dissimilarities between atomic structures is important for the exploration of potential energy landscapes. However, the cell vectors together with the coordinates of the atoms, which are generally used to describe periodic systems, are quantities not directly suitable as fingerprints to distinguish structures. Based on a characterization of the local environment of all atoms in a cell, we introduce crystal fingerprints that can be calculated easily and define configurational distances between crystalline structures that satisfy the mathematical properties of a metric. This distance between two configurations is a measure of their similarity/dissimilarity and it allows in particular to distinguish structures. The new method can be a useful tool within various energy landscape exploration schemes, such as minima hopping, random search, swarm intelligence algorithms, andhigh-throughputscreenings."

This article presents the updated version of the database, now including 288 standardized structures in 92 space groups. Similar to what was available on the web page before, we present a complete description of each structure, including the formulas for the primitive vectors, all of the basis vectors, and the AFLOW commands to generate the standardized cells.

    "work reports the development of a robust and efficient method for assessing the similarity of structures on the basis of their interatomic distances. Using this method, we proposed a simple and unambiguous definition of crystal structure prototype based on hierarchical clustering theory, and constructed the crystal structure prototype database (CSPD) by filtering the known crystallographic structures in a database. With similar method, a program structure prototype analysis package (SPAP) was developed to remove similar structures in CALYPSO prediction results and extract predicted low energy structures for a separate theoretical structure database. A series of statistics describing the distribution of crystal structure prototypes in the CSPD was compiled to provide an important insight for structure prediction and high-throughput calculations. Illustrative examples of the application of the proposed database are given, including the generation of initial structures for structure prediction and determination of the prototype structure in databases. These examples demonstrate the CSPD to be a generally applicable and useful tool for materials discovery."
