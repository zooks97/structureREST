- Output Values (Esd) may have  been set to 99, 999 or 9999 to Avoid Format Overflow

- Derived Parameter SU's (= Esd's) may be Incorrect in Cases where Covariances in the Atom Parameters should have been taken
  into Account (e.g. Those Involving Atoms That were Refined with Constraints)

- ROUNDING, in particular of the Input Coordinate Data, may give deviating values for derived geometry parameters.
  However, differences should be within the associated esd-range.

- PLATON is NOT a Finished Program. The Implementation of Additional Options is Planned. Some of the More Advanced
  Features are Experimental and may Contain Loose Ends.

- The Communication of Glitches Encountered will be Appreciated: E-mail: a.l.spek@uu.nl
